Installation:

1.1 Place "requirements.txt", "cointegration.py, "functions.py", "training_and_testing.py", "settings.json",
 "excel_regenerator.py" and dataset file ("Commodity Futures Historical Data 2023.xlsm")
 into one separate folder, let's call it folder "Cointegration"

1.2 Install latest python3 on your computer from https://www.python.org/downloads/

1.3 Copy path to requirements.txt (for example: "/Users/john/python/src/cointegration/requirements.txt")
 now open app called Terminal (On MacOS) or Console (On Windows) and run following command:

 pip3 install -r /Users/john/python/src/cointegration/requirements.txt

 after this your application should install necessary packages for correct work of this python code.
 Note: only do it once, you don't need to do steps 1. 2. and 3. more than one time.


Settings:

2.1 Open settings.json, there you can change "Name" of a testing configuration, name should be closed in double quotes "".
 If you will run a test with the same name, make sure you setup another unique name or delete folder with previous results.

2.2 "PValueThreshold" is an important threshold. In hypothesis, if P-Value is less than 0.05, we can reject
 the null hypothesis and pair might be cointegrated, but with this setting, you can set P-Value threshold.
 Test will run those pairs of instruments, which are under the setting of "PValueThreshold", keep that in mind.

2.3 "PathToExcelFileWithData" is also going to be used once / twice, you need to copy path to the original dataset, that
 you provided to me (Commodity Futures Historical Data 2023.xlsm) and paste it there, between "".


Datasets:

3.1 Your original dataset was in a very bad state (unordered, missing values, bad shape), that's why I created a script,
 that restructures data into .csv files which will be located in "datasets" folder (it will be generated automatically).
 After setting "PathToExcelFileWithData" in settings (step 2.3) you need to copy path to Cointegration folder
 (for example: "/Users/john/python/src/Cointegration") and open Terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows)
 and run following commands, one after another:

 cd /Users/john/python/src/Cointegration/

 python3 excel_regenerator.py

 After successful execution, you'll find a new folder "datasets" with csv files and their names will be equal to instruments.
 If in future, you'll want to add more datasets, you won't be able to use excel_regenerator.py,
 because it is specifically made for (Commodity Futures Historical Data 2023.xlsm). Instead you'll have to create csv files
 with exactly the same format. Name them as a trading instrument.csv and inside there must be column "Date" and "Close".

3.2 After that you can delete Commodity Futures Historical Data 2023.xlsm, because cointegration test only uses datasets folder


Backtesting:

4.1 After creating a dataset folder, it's time to backtest your data, process works like this, you setup "PValueThreshold"
 and run it, it will create all the results in a shape of pictures sorted by folders in following format:
 After you run a backtest, you'll see new folder called "Results" + name of backtest (from settings.json), remember, every
 test must have unique name or you can also delete older test by deleting corresponding folder. Inside of folder with Results
 you'll find all the data, which is also sorted by folders and separate pictures.

4.2 In order to perform a backtest, copy path to Cointegration folder (for example: /Users/john/python/src/Cointegration)
 open Terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run following commands, one after another:

 cd /Users/john/python/src/Cointegration

 python3 cointegration.py

 after running it, you'll see that program started processing data and generating results in Cointegration folder.
